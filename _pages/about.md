PhD student under the supervision of [Antoine Chambaz](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~chambaz/), [Christophe Denis](https://perso.math.u-pem.fr/denis.christophe/) and [Mohamed Hebiri](https://perso.math.u-pem.fr/hebiri.mohamed/).

I study Algorithmic Fairness for Multiclass Classification and Causal Frameworks. 

After a double Bachelor's program at [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/), I went for a [Part III (Master of Advanced Studies)](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html) in Mathematical Statistics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and the [M2A (Master 2 in Algorithms and Learning)](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/formation-sciences/offre-de-formation/masters/master-mathematiques-et-applications/m2-parcours-5) at [Sorbonne Université](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/). During my time at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), I wrote my Part III Essay on Missing and Unmeasurable Data, under the supervision of Professor [John Aston](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/jada2). My studies were brought to completion by undergoing a research internship on Set-Valued Classification under Fairness Constraints, under the supervision of [Christophe Denis](https://perso.math.u-pem.fr/denis.christophe/) and [Mohamed Hebiri](https://perso.math.u-pem.fr/hebiri.mohamed/).
